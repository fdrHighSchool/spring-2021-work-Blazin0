Sometimes, we want to modify existing inherited methods. This is called overriding methods.
Overriding an inherited method means providing a public method in a subclass with the same method signature.(method name)
Don’t get overriding a method confused with overloading a method
Overloading a method is when several methods have the same name but the parameter types, order, or number are different.

super(); or super(arguments); calls just the super constructor if put in as the first line of a subclass constructor.

super.method(); calls a superclass’ method (not constructors).
9.5
If you have multiple subclasses that inherit from a superclass, you can form an inheritance hierarchy.
Every subclass is-a or is a kind of the superclass.

Another advantage of an inheritance hierarchy is that we can write methods with parameters of the superclass type
and pass in subclass objects to them.
Using inheritance hierarchies, we can create arrays and ArrayLists using the superclass type
and put in values that are of the subclass type.
